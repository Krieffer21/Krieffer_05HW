# Krieffer_05HW_WorkDayScheduler
## This assignment was to create a calendar application using moment.js that saves events for each hour of the day. Every hour is color coordinated to past present and future events. When the saved button is clicked it saves the text input to local storage so the user can refresh the page while keeping their text input.
